                    <p>I'm probably not the typical designer positioned 
                        behind an Illustrator artboard adjusting pixels, but I design. 
                        Immersed in stylesheets tweaking font sizes and contemplating layouts 
                        is where you'll find me (~_^). I'm committed to creating fluent user 
                        experiences while staying fashionable.

                    <p>In building JavaScript applications, 
                        I'm equipped with just the right tools, 
                        and can absolutely function independently of them to 
                        deliver fast, resilient solutions optimized for 
                        scale â€” performance and scalabilty are priorities on my radar.
